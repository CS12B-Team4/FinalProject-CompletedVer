Welcome to Group4’s Clicking Game! Below are instructions as to how to go about playing the game:


When you initialize the java file titled “Game”, a window will pop up with two options: Create Player Account and Log In. Initially, you would want to click on “Create Player Account” in which you will be asked to enter a username and a password&nbsp; - make sure your username is NOT separated by any spaces! Next, after clicking OK, you will be directed to the game page. Here you will be able to play a simple game in which you earn points by clicking on the falling squares that are falling at various, random speeds. You can pause the game and resume, you can start over if you feel like you are off to a bad start. After the game is over you have three options: 1. View Ranking 2. Restart and 3. Set Music.


The first option view ranking will show your score from your previous game and indicate how well you did in comparison to other players who has played in the past. The second options simply restarts the game again, and the third option allows you to turn off the music if it annoys you too much :)


If you exit the program and play again, you should be able to Log in with your pre-existing username and password. Your ranking will change if you achieve a new high score.


The password and usernames are stored in a file titled “Results.txt”.
